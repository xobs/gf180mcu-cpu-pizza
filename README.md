# Pizza Processors üçï

A collection of various CPU cores on a single die as a demonstration of relative compute size.

## Rationale

There are many CPU cores available, and it can be difficult to select one. This project aims to place CPU cores on a die to compare their relative sizes, strengths, and weaknesses.
